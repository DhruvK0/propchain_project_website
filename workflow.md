      <h2>Workflow and Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        PropChain has already demonstrated its potential to transform real estate transactions. Here’s a look at our workflow, results, and future plans:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project Timeline</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Research and planning – identifying pain points in real estate transactions and designing a blockchain-based solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Development – building the platform’s core features, including smart contracts, property search, and verification.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 3</strong>: Testing – conducting internal tests and refining the platform based on results.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Launch – making PropChain available to the public and gathering real-world data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Key Results</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Faster Transactions</strong>: By automating processes, PropChain reduces transaction times from weeks to days.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Costs</strong>: Eliminating intermediaries cuts costs for buyers, sellers, and agents.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Transparency</strong>: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring trust and accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>User Engagement</strong>: The token incentive system encourages active participation, creating a community of users.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Ensuring the accuracy of property listings.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Implementing geolocation and EXIF-based verification, with plans to integrate AI for further improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Making the platform accessible to non-technical users, and those who dont necessarily want to buy properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Designing an intuitive interface, multiple account creation methods, and removing the necessity to set-up a wallet to use other features, such as title search.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Future Improvements</strong>:
          <ul>

            <li><strong>Cross-Border Transactions</strong>: Expanding the platform to support international real estate deals.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Verification</strong>: Using AI to analyze uploaded photos and ensure they match the property’s location.</li>
            <li><strong>Token Ecosystem</strong>: Expanding the use of tokens to incentivize more user actions, such as property listings and reviews.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
